# Integrating Sphere
This project controls the RGB LED for an integrating sphere.  We needed this calibration tool and put our 3D printer and miscellaneous open source hardware to work.  You can read
more on how we use this on our [blog](http://blog.canary.is/2014/11/20/a-custom-canary-integrating-sphere).

Check out the 3D Model on [Thingverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:554161) and the circuit on [Upverter](https://upverter.com/Canary/e8dc7b97dd5d9624/Integrating-Sphere/).
