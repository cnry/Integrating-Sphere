# Integrating Sphere
This Arduino Project controls the RGB LED for an integrating sphere we 3D printed.  You can read
more on how we use this device on our [blog](http://blog.canary.is/2014/11/20/a-custom-canary-integrating-sphere).

Check out the 3D Model on [Thingverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:554161) and the circuit on [Upverter](https://upverter.com/Canary/e8dc7b97dd5d9624/Integrating-Sphere/).
